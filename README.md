Trying to learn how to make my SASS compile to css so its a little messy

(boiler plate for all future projects)

> computers are dumb. humans make them smart.

## why does this exist?

- dont start with blank files
- common boilerplate for web projects
- i am a human being who makes mistakes.

Steps to compile SCSS to CSS:

`npm init -y`
`npm install sass`
then in package.json we made the line: "watch": "sass --watch ./src/scss:public/css" (input:output)
npm run watch compiles it to css
